# VirusBreak
VirusBreak is a javascript based web simulator of virus outbreaks.

You can view a population being infected by viruses with different properties.  You can explore how the effect of vaccination or quarantine affect the ability of virus outbreaks to spread. You can also see how the properties of different viruses such as their virulence or incubtation time will change how effective preventative measures are.

## About This Fork

Intended for those who are not bothered to enter every single data entry by hand.

I've forked the original repository and added some minor tweaks: 

+ now automatically records data every 10 days 
+ an export feature, so one could paste the data into Google Sheets, Excel *etc*.  
+ improved performance 
+ the day count now starts at zero 
+ some other random stuff which I can't remember 

However, the logic of the simulation should remain unchanged in this version. 

*I totally didn't do this so I could procrastinate.*
